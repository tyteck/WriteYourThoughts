# WriteYourThoughts

## Description
My projects are missing some content that google could index.
I would want to create a simple "thoughts" package.

In short : Simple blog package to be used with my laravel framework projects

**By the way my first open source package.**


php artisan vendor:publish

accessible with :
* /thoughts => list all thoughts
* /thoughts/the_slug_title_of_my_thoughts => show the thought detail
* /thoughts/create => admin only - create new thought
* /thoughts/edit/the_slug_title_of_my_thoughts => admin only - update thought
* /thoughts/delete/the_slug_title_of_my_thoughts => admin only - delete thought
